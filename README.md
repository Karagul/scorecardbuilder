# scorecardbuilder

R/Shiny interface to build a credit risk scorecard.

**Please note: This project is under heavy development. While the master branch will always contain a fully functional application, the interface is subject to revision on a periodic basis. It is expected to be relatively stable after 30th June, 2019.**

This application is a Web-based interface to develop credit risk scorecards. It covers all aspects of the scorecard development process

* Data Upload
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Sampling
* Binning (Weight of Evidence and Information Value calculation)
* Scorecard Development and Alignment
* Scorecard Validation

(Reject Inference, an important component in the development of application scorecards, will be supported in a future release).
